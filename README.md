# belly-button-challenge


In this assignment, you'll create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which tracks microbial species in human navels. The dataset reveals that a few microbial species are common in over 70% of individuals, while most are rare. Your task is to build visualizations, like bar and bubble charts, to display these findings interactively, enhancing your skills in data visualization and interactive design.
